# This project contains facilitated exclusion processes (FEP) or continuous lattice gas (CLG) models in C++ used during 2023 to deploy on AMAREL cluster at Rutgers during my PhD thesis in statistical physics. This was based on a 2-row ladder model whose properties were studied in my thesis:

# https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/71653/PDF/1/play/

# It used an object oriented approach to lattice models with C++ "naked arrays" under the hood as the container of the state of the lattice at any given time


# TODO list
* Upload CLG codes
* check that "double-folder" problem
* explain to viewers some of the versions of the C++ header files
